# Keycap Tray

An OpenSCAD implementation of a tray to keep your keycaps in. The tray is
organized into a grid, where the number of rows and columns are parameters. Uses
[Vector76's Gridfinity library][vector76-lib] to render the tray inside an
appropriately sized Gridfinity container.

Consider giving this project a like on Printables, and sharing your make there
if you build it.
